How to release

    Make sure you're on master and synced to HEAD
    Ensure the project builds and tests run (sanity check only, obviously)
        parallel -j0 exec ::: test/*_test can help ensure everything at least passes
    Prepare release notes
        git log $(git describe --abbrev=0 --tags)..HEAD gives you the list of commits between the last annotated tag and HEAD
        Pick the most interesting.
    Create a release through github's interface
        Note this will create a lightweight tag.
        Update this to an annotated tag:
            git pull --tags
            git tag -a -f <tag> <tag>
            git push --force origin
            git push --tags

#### GUI for history of commits
```bash
sudo apt install gitk
```
